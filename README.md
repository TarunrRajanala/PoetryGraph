Poetic Walks: Graph-Based Poetry Generation

Project Overview:

This project explores Natural Language Processing by generating poetry using an N-gram model and graph-based techniques. The program creates a "word affinity" graph from a corpus of text, then uses bridge words to enrich and transform a basic input into a poetic output. The goal is to showcase the intersection of graphs and language, turning structured data into creative expressions.

Key Features:

N-gram Word Affinity Graph: Constructs a graph from a given corpus where vertices represent unique words and weighted edges reflect adjacency counts, enabling bridge word discovery for poetic transformation.
Graph-Based Poem Generation: Given a plain input phrase, the program searches for optimal bridge words between word pairs, creating a poetic output that is contextually enriched.
Weighted Bigram Model: Implements a bigram model to handle multiple bridge words between word pairs, selecting the bridge word with the highest weight for enhanced poetic quality.

Skills Demonstrated:

Practical application of N-grams and graph traversal techniques for text transformation.
Proficient use of Java to implement graph structures, weighted edges, and search algorithms.
